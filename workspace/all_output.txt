Assert:
To test a 'Hello World' console application, the console output is compared with the expected output. 

In the case of this simple application, the expected output is the string "Hello World!". 

Unfortunately, as a console application runs independently of other applications, traditional automated unit testing methods can't be used. 

However, one alternative method is to visually inspect the console output when the application is run to make sure "Hello World!" is displayed. 

Here are the steps to test the 'Hello World' console application:

1. Open the command prompt.

2. Traverse to the location of your compiled C# console application.

3. Enter the command `dotnet run`.

4. You should see "Hello World!" displayed on the console. If this output is observed, the test is considered as passed. 

This manual method has limitations and is not applicable to large and complex applications wherein you have multiple computations or operations. In such cases, you would use other testing tools and methodologies to test your applications.
