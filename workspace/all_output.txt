If you're looking for the code to create a "Hello World" console app in C#, here it is:

```csharp
using System;

namespace HelloWorld
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
        }
    }
}
```

And here is how to run and test this app:

1. Save this code in a file named `Program.cs`.

2. Open your terminal or command prompt.

3. Navigate to the directory where you saved your `Program.cs` file.

4. Run the command `csc Program.cs` to compile your program. This will create `Program.exe`.

5. Run the command `Program.exe`.

6. You should see "Hello World!" displayed on the console. If you see this output, your program is working as expected.
