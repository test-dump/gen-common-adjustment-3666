Specification: Here is a simple step-by-step procedure to create a Hello World console application in C#:

1. First, ensure that you have .NET Core SDK installed on your machine. If not, download and install it.

2. Open your IDE or a simple text editor and create a new file called `Program.cs`.

3. Now you are going to write the code for the Hello World application. 

4. Write or paste the following lines of code:

    ```csharp
        using System;

        namespace HelloWorld
        {
            class Program
            {
                static void Main(string[] args)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
                }
            }
        }
    ```

5. The code can be explained as follows: 

    - `using System;` is a directive to C# compiler to use System namespace.
    
    - `namespace HelloWorld` HelloWorld is the namespace that contains the class Program.
    
    - `class Program` is a basic unit of a program, and it is a blueprint of an object.
    
    - `static void Main(string[] args)` The Main method is the entry point of a C# console application. When the program started, the Main method is the first method that gets invoked.
    
    - `Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");` The WriteLine() method outputs the Hello World! text on the screen.

6. After you finish writing the code, save the file.

7. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where you have your `Program.cs` file. 

8. Type `csc Program.cs` and hit enter. This command will create `Program.exe` file. 

9. Type `Program` and hit enter to run the program.

10. The message "Hello World!" should display on the console.
   
By following these steps, you should be able to create a simple Hello World console application in C#. It's a great way to start learning and understanding the basics of C#.
