Firstly, you need to have .NET Framework or .NET Core and a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment(IDE) like Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code installed on your computer.\n\n2. Open your text editor or IDE and create a new .NET Core Console App project. Name your project \"HelloWorld\".\n\n3. Replace the auto-generated code with the following:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\n\nnamespace HelloWorld\n{\n    class Program\n    {\n        static void Main(string[] args)\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Hello World!\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis program is a simple \"Hello, World!\" console application in C#. Here is the breakdown of how it works:\n\n- `using System;` - This line includes the System namespace, which contains basic classes and base classes that define commonly-used value and reference data types, events and event handlers, interfaces, attributes, and processing exceptions.\n\n- `namespace HelloWorld` - A namespace is used to organize your code and is collection of classes, interfaces, structs, enums and delegates.\n\n- `class Program` - Here we declare our class name to be Program. Class is a blueprint of data and functions or methods. Class should be declared inside a namespace. Here our class is `Program`.\n\n- `static void Main(string[] args)` - The main method is the entry point of a C# application. When the application is started, the Main method is the first method that is invoked. If the Main method is not present in your code, the code will not execute.\n\n- `Console.WriteLine(\"Hello World!\");` - This line includes a class `Console` in `System` namespace with a method `WriteLine` (available to classes that import the System namespace) that prints the specified data to the console.\n\n4. After writing the code, save your file.\n\n5. Open Command Prompt(Terminal in Mac or Linux) in the folder containing your program and type `dotnet run` to compile and run your C# program.\n\n6. When you run your application, it will output \"Hello World!\" in the console."},{"role":"user","content":"Unit tests:\n\nSpecification: Here is a simple step-by-step procedure to create a Hello World console application in C#:\n\n1. First, ensure that you have .NET Core SDK installed on your machine. If not, download and install it.\n\n2. Open your IDE or a simple text editor and create a new file called `Program.cs`.\n\n3. Now you are going to write the code for the Hello World application. \n\n4. Write or paste the following lines of code:\n\n    ```csharp\n        using System;\n\n        namespace HelloWorld\n        {\n            class Program\n            {\n                static void Main(string[] args)\n                {\n                    Console.WriteLine(\"Hello World!\");\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    ```\n\n5. The code can be explained as follows: \n\n    - `using System;` is a directive to C# compiler to use System namespace.\n    \n    - `namespace HelloWorld` HelloWorld is the namespace that contains the class Program.\n    \n    - `class Program` is a basic unit of a program, and it is a blueprint of an object.\n    \n    - `static void Main(string[] args)` The Main method is the entry point of a C# console application. When the program started, the Main method is the first method that gets invoked.\n    \n    - `Console.WriteLine(\"Hello World!\");` The WriteLine() method outputs the Hello World! text on the screen.\n\n6. After you finish writing the code, save the file.\n\n7. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where you have your `Program.cs` file. \n\n8. Type `csc Program.cs` and hit enter. This command will create `Program.exe` file. \n\n9. Type `Program` and hit enter to run the program.\n\n10. The message \"Hello World!\" should display on the console.\n   \nBy following these steps, you should be able to create a simple Hello World console application in C#. It's a great way to start learning and understanding the basics of C#."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Assert:\nTo test a 'Hello World' console application, the console output is compared with the expected output. \n\nIn the case of this simple application, the expected output is the string \"Hello World!\". \n\nUnfortunately, as a console application runs independently of other applications, traditional automated unit testing methods can't be used. \n\nHowever, one alternative method is to visually inspect the console output when the application is run to make sure \"Hello World!\" is displayed. \n\nHere are the steps to test the 'Hello World' console application:\n\n1. Open the command prompt.\n\n2. Traverse to the location of your compiled C# console application.\n\n3. Enter the command `dotnet run`.\n\n4. You should see \"Hello World!\" displayed on the console. If this output is observed, the test is considered as passed. \n\nThis manual method has limitations and is not applicable to large and complex applications wherein you have multiple computations or operations. In such cases, you would use other testing tools and methodologies to test your applications."}]
