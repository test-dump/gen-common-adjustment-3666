Save this code in a file named `Program.cs`.\n\n2. Open your terminal or command prompt.\n\n3. Navigate to the directory where you saved your `Program.cs` file.\n\n4. Run the command `csc Program.cs` to compile your program. This will create `Program.exe`.\n\n5. Run the command `Program.exe`.\n\n6. You should see \"Hello World!\" displayed on the console. If you see this output, your program is working as expected.\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"```bash\ndotnet new console -o HelloWorld\ncp Program.cs HelloWorld/\ncd HelloWorld/\n\ndotnet run\n```"}]
