To write your first basic console application in C#, follow these steps:

1. Firstly, you need to have .NET Framework or .NET Core and a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment(IDE) like Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code installed on your computer.

2. Open your text editor or IDE and create a new .NET Core Console App project. Name your project "HelloWorld".

3. Replace the auto-generated code with the following:

```csharp
using System;

namespace HelloWorld
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
        }
    }
}
```

This program is a simple "Hello, World!" console application in C#. Here is the breakdown of how it works:

- `using System;` - This line includes the System namespace, which contains basic classes and base classes that define commonly-used value and reference data types, events and event handlers, interfaces, attributes, and processing exceptions.

- `namespace HelloWorld` - A namespace is used to organize your code and is collection of classes, interfaces, structs, enums and delegates.

- `class Program` - Here we declare our class name to be Program. Class is a blueprint of data and functions or methods. Class should be declared inside a namespace. Here our class is `Program`.

- `static void Main(string[] args)` - The main method is the entry point of a C# application. When the application is started, the Main method is the first method that is invoked. If the Main method is not present in your code, the code will not execute.

- `Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");` - This line includes a class `Console` in `System` namespace with a method `WriteLine` (available to classes that import the System namespace) that prints the specified data to the console.

4. After writing the code, save your file.

5. Open Command Prompt(Terminal in Mac or Linux) in the folder containing your program and type `dotnet run` to compile and run your C# program.

6. When you run your application, it will output "Hello World!" in the console.
